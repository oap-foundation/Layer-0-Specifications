> **The Bedrock of the Autonomous Economy.**
>
> This repository contains the normative specifications for **Layer 0** of the Open Agent Protocol (OAP) framework. It defines how digital agents prove their identity, establish mutual trust, and negotiate secure communication channels without centralized intermediaries.

## 🔐 Scope of Layer 0

Layer 0 provides the **Root of Trust** for the entire stack. Before any message can be transported (Layer 1) or any transaction settled (Layer 2), agents must answer two fundamental questions:
1.  **"Who are you?"** (Authentication via DIDs)
2.  **"Can I trust you?"** (Verification via Credentials)

### Primary Specifications

| Acronym | Protocol Name | Version | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OAEP** | **Open Agent Exchange Protocol** | `1.0-RC` | ❄️ Freeze | The handshake protocol for mutual authentication, capability negotiation, and session key derivation. |

## ⚡ Key Technologies

Layer 0 mandates a specific set of cryptographic primitives to ensure a unified "Web of Trust":

### 1. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
We support two specific methods to balance privacy and reputation:
*   **`did:key`**: For ephemeral, private, peer-to-peer interactions (e.g., a burner wallet for a specific negotiation).
*   **`did:web`**: For long-lived, reputation-based identities bound to a DNS domain (e.g., `did:web:shop.example.com`).

### 2. The Agent Profile (VC)
Identity is more than a public key. Agents exchange **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** during the handshake to prove properties:
*   *"I am a certified Merchant."*
*   *"I am an accredited Medical Practitioner."*
*   *"I am a human-verified account."*

### 3. Cryptographic Agility
The current mandatory cipher suite (`OAEP-v1-2026`) uses:
*   **Signatures:** Ed25519
*   **Key Agreement:** X25519 (ECDH)
*   **Hashing:** BLAKE3
*   **Serialization:** JSON-LD with JCS Canonicalization

## 🏗 Relation to Other Layers

Layer 0 does **not** handle message transport or business logic. It provides the **Session Keys** and **Principal Identity** that higher layers rely on.

*   **Layer 0 (This Repo):** "Alice and Bob agree on encryption keys."
*   **Layer 1 (OATP):** "Alice sends encrypted shards to Bob via relays."
*   **Layer 2 (OACP):** "Alice buys a book from Bob."

## 🛠 Implementation

The OAP Foundation provides a reference implementation of the Layer 0 logic in Rust. This library handles the complex state machine of the OAEP handshake and the correct verification of DID documents.

*   **Reference Core:** [`oap-foundation/oap-core-rs`](https://github.com/oap-foundation/oap-core-rs)

**⚠️ Security Warning:** Do not attempt to implement the cryptographic handshake from scratch unless you are a cryptography expert. Use the reference core to ensure protection against Replay Attacks, Unknown Key-Share Attacks, and Timing Attacks.

## 🤝 Contributing

We are currently in **Code Freeze** for v1.0.
We welcome feedback regarding:
*   Security vulnerabilities in the handshake logic.
*   Ambiguities in the DID resolution steps.
*   Edge cases in Verifiable Credential validation.

Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.
